        <div class="story-text"><div class='attribution'></div><div class='story-text-body'>you walk down the length of the red runway.. showing off your awesome cosplay outfit. your is better than that guys, his is all dull grey. looking down at your stunning gown, you notice with alarm that the bow if as cream as clay. This doesnt match the rest of your costume. You rip the ribbon off... or you try to. Its not a ribbon, it's hard like clay. As you consider your fashion dilema, you spot a sharp feather dripping blood descending towards you. Ahh your goimg to get stabbed. You look up and notice a huge face and hand hovering above you. Reaslisation hits... Your a miniture being painted, thats explains why the other cosplayers are so silent, they aren't real......At least you enjoy War Hammer as it looks like you will spend the rest of your life playing... as a miniture character. The End</div></div>
