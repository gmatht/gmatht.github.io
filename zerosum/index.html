	  <h1>ZeroSum Accounts Reconciliation Tool</h1>

<p>This tool is designed to help you match up one or more receipts with a single reimbursement. This means you can easily keep track of receipts you have not yet reimbursed and audit your books.</p>

<p>Receipts are represented as negative values, and reimbursements as positive values.
In general, the input should be a value in Dollars and Cents, some white space,
and a description.</p>

<p>We are solving a special case of the zero-sum problem, which is NP-Complete;
a class of problems that can be very hard. So, instead of trying to find every
solution, we try to find the easiest solution. So if Dave has been reimbursed
for $3 and there is a receipt for $3 of Carrots, we assume Dave's reimbursement was
for the Carrots. We only consider the possibility that Dave's reimbursement
could have been for multiple receipts if it couldn't have been for a single receipt.</p>

<p>If the tool is too slow, you can try simplifying the problem by finding reimbursements corresponding to many receipts and removing those receipts from the tool's input. Alternatively, you can <a href="zerosum.zip">download</a> the tool and run it directly.</p>
